**Free, open source and performant** — a multi-agent harness that works with the
subscriptions you already pay for, on their hourly limits. It turns the terminal coding CLI
you already run into a clone of you, one that keeps working while you're away and
coordinates a whole office of agents on your own machine.

Wraps [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code), Antigravity (Gemini), OpenAI Codex,
**xAI Grok**, **Kimi Code**, **Gemini CLI**, **Qwen**, **OpenCode**, **Crush**,
**pi.dev**, **GitHub Copilot CLI**, and **Cursor** — with bring-your-own keys and local LLMs.
Agents that message, route, and remember, coordinated by **your clone** (Michael) and
visualized as avatars at work on a shared office floor.

terminal, with your existing subscription and its hourly limits. If it runs in a terminal, it
can run here.

## What it is

Munder Difflin is a desktop app that wraps **real terminal-agent CLIs** as fully-capable agents,
wires them into a **hive mind**, and puts **your clone** in charge — Michael, the one agent *you*
talk to in order to get things done. Under the hood it runs the **fastest memory layer in the
world** so every agent remembers what it learns and recalls it instantly.

- **Every terminal is an agent.** Each `claude`, `agy`, `codex`, `grok`, `kimi`, `qwen`, `opencode`, `crush`, `pi`, `copilot`, or custom session runs as a real
  process in a pseudo-terminal (`node-pty`), byte-for-byte authentic, rendered with xterm.js.
- **Every agent is an avatar.** Sessions appear as characters on a Pixi.js office floor — they walk
  to stations as they work, and envelopes fly desk-to-desk when they message each other.
- **The hive coordinates them.** Agents read their memory and drain a mailbox; the router moves
  messages between inboxes; the GOD agent adjudicates, assigns, and escalates only when it needs you.
- **Memory that's instant.** A markdown-first memory layer with a semantic recall index means agents
  remember across sessions and recall in milliseconds.

## How it works

```
            you ── talk to ──►  ┌─────────────┐
                                │  GOD agent  │  orchestrator / supervisor
                                │ (Michael's  │  roster · routing · adjudication
                                │   office)   │  blackboard · task ledger
                                └──────┬──────┘
                                       │ assigns · routes · escalates
              ┌────────────────────────┼────────────────────────┐
              ▼                         ▼                         ▼
        ┌───────────┐            ┌───────────┐            ┌───────────┐
        │  agent A  │  message   │  agent B  │  message   │  agent C  │
        │ provider  │ ─────────► │ provider  │ ─────────► │ provider  │
        │  + memory │            │  + memory │            │  + memory │
        └───────────┘            └───────────┘            └───────────┘
              └──────── shared hive: memory · mailbox · blackboard · log ───────┘
```

1. **You spawn agents** — each is a normal terminal process (`claude`, `agy`, `codex`, or custom)
   with its own working directory, identity, and provider-specific lifecycle.
2. **Agents collaborate through the hive** — a local git repo of plain files. They write to their own
   `outbox/`; the harness's router delivers into recipients' `inbox/`. No agent ever touches git
   (single-committer design avoids `index.lock` corruption).
3. **The GOD agent runs the floor** — it reads every request, resolves routine ones itself (keeping
   the system fully autonomous), and only escalates *critical* items (spend, destructive ops, scope
   changes) into an approvals queue you act on.
4. **Everything is visible** — you watch avatars move, envelopes fly, and the live terminal stream;
   you can type back into any session, browse its files, and read its git history.

See [`HIVE.md`](./HIVE.md) for the full multi-agent design, [`SPEC.md`](./SPEC.md) for the
terminal/event plane, and [`DESIGN.md`](./DESIGN.md) for the visual system.

## Features

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%" valign="middle">

### Talk to one agent, not twelve

Michael is your clone and the only agent you brief. He assigns the work, routes the traffic, and
escalates the few things that actually need you.

</td>
<td width="50%">

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%" valign="middle">

### Hire an agent in a few clicks

Pick the CLI, the model and the autonomy, give it a desk, and it starts working. Import a
ready made role from the [Agent Gallery](https://munderdiffl.in/hires/) if you would rather not
start from scratch.

</tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%" valign="middle">

### Memory that survives the session

Every agent keeps markdown memory that is mined into a shared, searchable palace. Close the app,
come back tomorrow, and they still know what they learned.

### Autonomy with a leash

Set how far each agent may go on its own. Spend, scope and destructive operations come back to
you, and a circuit breaker steers, constrains, then stops anything that loops or runs away.

Agents walk to stations as they work and envelopes fly desk to desk when they message each other.
Click any desk to read that terminal live, and type straight back into it.

**The floor**
- **Every terminal is a real agent.** Claude Code, Antigravity (Gemini), OpenAI Codex, xAI Grok, Kimi Code, Gemini CLI, Qwen, OpenCode, Crush, pi.dev, GitHub Copilot CLI, Cursor, or a custom command — each in its own `node-pty` PTY, rendered with xterm.js.
- **Every agent is an avatar.** A Pixi.js office floor where agents walk to stations, envelopes fly desk to desk, and avatar state reflects real work.
- **A GOD orchestrator you talk to.** It routes tasks, adjudicates traffic, and escalates only what needs a human. Or press **Talk** and run the floor by voice.
- **Per-agent git worktrees.** Optional isolation so parallel agents never collide on branches.

**Memory & coordination**
- **The hive** — per-agent memory, atomic-file mailboxes, a shared blackboard, an append-only event log, single-committer git.
- **Semantic recall** — markdown memory mined into a shared palace, searchable from the UI, with condensation so it doesn't grow forever.
- **Enterprise Knowledge Graph** — your own documents and policies, queryable by any agent.

**Control & safety**
- **Human gates** — spend, scope, and destructive ops escalate to you. Steer mid-run or stop gracefully.
- **Circuit breaker** — a steer → constrain → stop ladder for agents that loop, storm errors, or blow their budget.
- **Budgets & telemetry** — per-agent token budgets, real cost from transcripts, a durable ledger, OTel spans, and a tool waterfall.

**Command Center**
- Kanban tasks with dependencies, scheduled missions + heartbeat, live fleet monitoring, memory search, activity log, and a CI watcher.
- **Skills** — what every agent can already do across Claude Code, OpenCode and Codex, plus a browsable catalog of 227 more with search, filters, install and uninstall.
- **Built-in Monaco IDE** — file tree, editor tabs, save, plus CHANGES · HISTORY · COMPARE git rails with commit graph, diffs, branch compare, and guarded checkout. All fs/git access brokered through main.

**Getting work in and out**
- **Slack & webhooks** — message a channel or POST a webhook; Michael can spawn an ephemeral worker, reply in-thread, and tear it down.
- **Shareable hires + Agent Gallery** — import a role from a `munderdifflin://hire` link; import only pre-fills the form, a human still spawns it. Browse roles at the [Agent Gallery](https://munderdiffl.in/hires/).
- **BYOK keys + local LLMs** — per-provider keys in a write-only secret broker, plus Ollama / LM Studio / vLLM base URLs. Guides: [open models](https://munderdiffl.in/blog/run-munder-difflin-on-open-models/) · [Mac Mini](https://munderdiffl.in/blog/run-munder-difflin-on-a-mac-mini/).
- **Updates in one click**: the title-bar badge runs the real update. It downloads the build for your machine, then restarts and installs it, and it reads `latest` once a check confirms you are current. A manual download is the fallback for when the updater cannot fetch the build itself. The first run afterwards opens that release's notes as a designed page rather than a version number.
- **Your language**: English, Simplified Chinese and Arabic, with right to left layout for Arabic. English is the default and nothing changes until you pick another one in Settings. The app does not read your OS locale. All three app fonts ship inside the bundle, so nothing is fetched at boot.
- **Prerequisites** — one Settings page showing which supporting tools (uv, git, Node, MemPalace, each agent CLI) you have, what each is for, and a button that asks Michael to install what is missing.

> [!NOTE]
> **Status: v0.4.6, the release where the app stops assuming everyone reads English left to right.**
> The interface now runs in Simplified Chinese and Arabic, with right to left support. English
> stays the default and nothing changes until you pick a language in Settings, under General; the
> app never reads your operating system locale. All three app fonts now ship inside the bundle
> instead of loading from Google, which is blocked in mainland China and was breaking the interface
> for exactly the people the Chinese translation was for. An input method Enter no longer fires a
> send, a search or a rename while a candidate word is still being composed.
> Every string is translated, with nothing falling back to English, and the terminals read right to
> left. Some screens still need their padding and icons mirrored, and that is the next piece of
> work. No Arabic reader has reviewed the wording yet.
> Also in this release: the update badge runs the real download and restart instead of handing you
> a disk image, the update check can no longer spin forever, Settings persists through one Save
> button, the model lists moved into a checked in catalog, and the ASK ME card renders markdown.
> On the security side: the name of the CLI an agent launches is validated before it is resolved
> against your PATH, the OS sandbox stays on in auto mode, and analytics stopped sending IP and
> derived location. Telemetry now counts the messages you send to an agent, a count and nothing
> else, with no text, length or hash of the body in any shape.
> 16 community pull requests from 13 contributors landed in this release, one of them (#213)
> re-implemented rather than merged.
> **If you're on 0.3.8, update:** that build's usage-limit guard never released the agents it held,
> and it has been removed entirely.
> macOS (signed & notarized), Windows, and Linux builds are on the
> [releases page](https://github.com/chaitanyagiri/munder-difflin/releases/latest).

## Getting started

### Download the app

**Most people want this one.** Signed and notarized macOS builds, plus Windows and Linux, are on
the [latest release](https://github.com/chaitanyagiri/munder-difflin/releases/latest). Install it,
open it, and the wizard takes you the rest of the way. You do not need Node, a toolchain, or this
repository.

You do still need at least one agent CLI on your machine, and the app can install missing ones for
you from **Settings → Prerequisites**.

### Build from source

Everything below is for contributors and for people who want to run an unreleased build.

### Prerequisites

- **macOS, Windows, or Linux**.
- **Node.js 18+** and npm.
- A **C/C++ toolchain** for `node-pty`'s native addon — on macOS, install Xcode Command Line Tools:
  ```bash
  xcode-select --install
  ```
- At least one supported agent CLI on your `PATH` — **[Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)**
  (`claude`, the default), **Antigravity** (`agy`), **OpenAI Codex** (`codex`), **xAI Grok** (`grok`),
  **Kimi Code** (`kimi`), **Gemini CLI** (`gemini`), **Qwen** (`qwen`), **OpenCode** (`opencode`),
  **Crush** (`crush`), **pi.dev** (`pi`), **GitHub Copilot** (`copilot`), or **Cursor** (`cursor-agent`).
  Most missing CLIs self-heal: the harness runs the installer in the
  terminal and continues into the new binary.
- *Optional:* **your own API keys and local LLMs** in **Settings → AI Engines** (Ollama / LM Studio / vLLM).
- *Optional:* the semantic memory index for instant cross-session recall — markdown memory works without it.

### Install & run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chaitanyagiri/munder-difflin.git
cd munder-difflin
npm install        # postinstall rebuilds node-pty against Electron's ABI
npm run dev        # launches the Electron app with hot reload
```

On first launch you'll go through the onboarding wizard, then land on the floor. Use **Add agent** to
spawn your first session — the GOD agent seats itself in Michael's office automatically.

### Other scripts

```bash
npm run build      # production build via electron-vite
npm run preview    # preview the production build
npm run typecheck  # type-check the node (main/preload) and web (renderer) projects
```

> If `node-pty` fails to load after an Electron upgrade, re-run `npm install` (the `postinstall` hook
> runs `electron-rebuild` against the current Electron ABI).

## Architecture

Two data planes feed one renderer: a **terminal plane** that owns the PTYs, the filesystem and git,
and an **event plane** that runs the hive, the hook server and the router. The renderer talks to
both only through a typed bridge.

**The full diagrams, the module by module project structure, and the design system live in
[`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](./docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).** They moved out of this file so it can explain
the product rather than the codebase. Also see [`HIVE.md`](./HIVE.md) for the multi-agent design,
[`SPEC.md`](./SPEC.md) for the terminal and event plane, and [`DESIGN.md`](./DESIGN.md) for the
visual system.

<div align="right">(<a href="#munder-difflin">↑ back to top</a>)</div>

## Roadmap

Shipped through **v0.4.6**: a Simplified Chinese and Arabic interface with right to left support
and self-hosted fonts, twelve agent engines with BYOK keys and local LLMs, voice orchestration,
the hive (memory · mailboxes · blackboard · event log), Command Center with kanban and weekday
schedules, a built-in Monaco IDE with git rails, integrations registry + secret broker,
Slack-spawned workers, shareable hires and the Agent Gallery, observability and the circuit
breaker, durable persistence, session resume, multi-window floors, one click updates, a Skills
browser, a live Prerequisites check, cost reporting folded from the ledger, semantic memory
that works on Apple Silicon, and an updater that installs the build instead of pointing at it.
Full history in [`CHANGELOG.md`](./CHANGELOG.md).

Next up:

- [ ] **More chat integrations** — Telegram and richer chat bridges that pipe a channel into Michael's queue and route replies back out.
- [ ] **More engines & integration templates** — keep growing the engine roster and the integrations registry.
- [ ] **Fuller avatar coverage** — drive the remaining station visits and tool-bubbles entirely from real hook events.
- [ ] **Durable layout & command history** — extend persistence to agent layout and per-session history.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome — this is pre-release software with a lot of surface area. Start with
[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md). The short version: fork, `npm install && npm run dev`, keep
`npm run typecheck` green, and **derive any new UI from [`DESIGN.md`](./DESIGN.md) tokens**. Good
first areas: wiring real hook events, the add-agent flow, the config drawer, and cross-platform work.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Every pull request must show a before and an after** — screenshots, or a recording when the
> thing moves — under the `### Before` and `### After` headings in the PR template. This is checked
> automatically and a PR without it does not merge. "My change has no UI" is not an exemption; it
> just changes what the evidence looks like. See
> [Evidence is mandatory](./CONTRIBUTING.md#evidence-is-mandatory).

Questions, bugs, or want to show off your office? Join the Discord: **<https://discord.gg/SEDzP5ZPk5>**. Add your Discord handle to a PR and you'll get the `employee of the month` role when it merges.

**Looking for somewhere to start?** The
[`good first issue`](https://github.com/chaitanyagiri/munder-difflin/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
list is kept stocked with small, self contained work that has a clear finish line.

## Telemetry

Official builds send a **small set of anonymous usage events** (app opened, agent spawned, feature
used) — never prompts, code, file paths, or agent output. The complete event list, the anonymity
guarantees, and the three ways to opt out (Settings toggle, `DO_NOT_TRACK`, or building from
source — forks compile with no key and send nothing) are documented in
[`TELEMETRY.md`](./TELEMETRY.md).
